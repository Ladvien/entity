## ðŸ“š Crafting Beautiful Documentation

Your project's documentation lives in the `project_root/docs/` folder and serves as the welcoming front door to your work. Think of it as your project's autobiography - it should tell the story of what you've built, why it matters, and how others can join the journey.

### Essential Components

**ReadTheDocs Integration** - Connect your repository to ReadTheDocs for automatic building and hosting. Configure your `.readthedocs.yaml` file to specify Python version, requirements, and build settings. This creates a professional, searchable documentation site that updates with every commit.

**Sphinx Configuration** - Your `conf.py` file is the control center. Set up extensions like `autodoc` for automatic API documentation, `napoleon` for Google-style docstrings, and `sphinx_rtd_theme` for that polished look. Don't forget to configure your project metadata and version handling.

**Markdown Magic** - Structure your content with clear hierarchies. Start with a compelling `index.md` that hooks readers immediately. Create separate files for installation, quickstart guides, API references, and examples. Use consistent formatting, helpful code blocks, and engaging language that makes complex topics approachable.

**The Human Touch** - Sprinkle in personality through friendly explanations, real-world examples, and occasional humor. Documentation doesn't have to be dry - make it a conversation with your future users and collaborators.

Remember: great documentation is written for the person discovering your project at 2 AM, slightly caffeinated, trying to solve a pressing problem.

## Architecture Overview for AI Agents

The Entity Pipeline Framework follows a **linear pipeline architecture** with these stages:

```
User Request â†’ Parse â†’ Think â†’ Do â†’ Review â†’ Deliver â†’ Response
                â†“       â†“      â†“      â†“         â†“        â†‘
              Error â†’ Error â†’ Error â†’ Error â†’ Error â†’  Error 
```

## Development Resources

You have access to a postgres 16 database for development purposes. The database connection details are as follows:

- Database Type: PostgreSQL
- Connection String: `postgresql://agent@localhost:5432/dev_db`

There is no password.

Ollama is available for LLM interactions. The Ollama server is running locally with the following details:

Host: localhost
Port: 11434
Model: tinyllama
Auth: None (insecure dev only)

Startup: Automatically launched in background by the dev init script.

### Pipeline Stages

- **Parse**: Input validation, context setup, memory retrieval
- **Think**: Reasoning, planning, intent classification, decision making
- **Do**: Tool execution, action orchestration, external API calls
- **Review**: Response formatting, safety checks, content filtering
- **Deliver**: Output transmission (HTTP, TTS, file operations)
- **Error**: User-friendly error communication and logging

## Coding Conventions for AI Agents

### General Conventions

- Use Python 3.11+ with type hints for all new code
- Follow black style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable, method, constant, and function names.  Ensure they describe intent.
- Add comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- Use type hints
- Favor dataclasses, pydantic mode;s, or other structured data types
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Ensure code is readable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns


### Plugin Development Guidelines

All plugins must inherit from base plugin classes and follow these patterns:

```python
class MyPlugin(PromptPlugin):  # or ResourcePlugin, ToolPlugin, AdapterPlugin, FailurePlugin
    dependencies = ["database", "ollama"]  # List dependency registry keys
    stages = [PipelineStage.THINK]  # Explicitly declare execution stages
    
    @classmethod
    def validate_config(cls, config: Dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate plugin configuration (no external dependencies)"""
        # Implementation here
        return ValidationResult.success()
    
    async def _execute_impl(self, context: PluginContext):
        """Main plugin logic implementation"""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Plugin Types and Responsibilities

1. **ResourcePlugin**: Infrastructure (databases, LLMs, logging)
2. **ToolPlugin**: User functions (weather, calculator, search)
3. **PromptPlugin**: Processing logic (reasoning, memory, coordination)
4. **AdapterPlugin**: Input/output interfaces (HTTP, TTS, CLI)
5. **FailurePlugin**: Error handling (formatters, loggers, notifications)

### Configuration Management

- All configuration uses YAML format with environment variable interpolation
- Environment variables use `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax
- Configuration validation happens at load time, not runtime
- Plugin dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

### Context Interface Usage

Plugins interact through a controlled context interface:

```python
# Resource access
llm = context.get_resource("ollama")
db = context.get_resource("database")

# Tool execution (immediate)
result_key = context.execute_tool("weather", {"location": "Seattle"})

# Conversation management
context.add_conversation_entry(content="...", role="assistant")
history = context.get_conversation_history(last_n=10)

# Response control
context.set_response("Final response to user")

# Stage results
context.set_stage_result("reasoning_complete", True)
result = context.get_stage_result("intent_classification")

# Error handling
context.add_failure(FailureInfo(...))
```

## Testing Requirements for AI Agents

AI agents should run tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests for specific plugin type
pytest tests/plugins/resources/
pytest tests/plugins/tools/
pytest tests/plugins/prompts/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ -m performance
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for each plugin in isolation
- Use mocked dependencies for resource plugins
- Test configuration validation separately from plugin logic
- Include integration tests for complete pipeline flows
- Test error handling and failure scenarios
- Validate plugin stage assignments and dependencies

## Plugin Implementation Patterns for AI Agents

### Resource Plugin Pattern
```python
class DatabaseResourcePlugin(ResourcePlugin):
    stages = [PipelineStage.PARSE, PipelineStage.THINK, 
             PipelineStage.DO, PipelineStage.REVIEW, 
             PipelineStage.DELIVER, PipelineStage.ERROR]
    
    async def initialize(self):
        """Set up database connections"""
        pass
    
    async def search_conversations(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search historical conversations"""
        pass
```

### Tool Plugin Pattern
```python
class WeatherToolPlugin(ToolPlugin):
    stages = [PipelineStage.DO]
    
    async def execute_function(self, params: Dict) -> str:
        """Execute weather lookup"""
        location = params.get("location")
        # Implementation here
        return weather_result
```

### Prompt Plugin Pattern
```python
class ChainOfThoughtPlugin(PromptPlugin):
    dependencies = ["ollama"]
    stages = [PipelineStage.THINK]
    
    async def _execute_impl(self, context: PluginContext):
        """Implement reasoning logic"""
        # Step-by-step reasoning using context.call_llm()
        pass
```

## Programmatic Checks for AI Agents

Before submitting changes, run these validation checks:

```bash
# Code formatting and linting
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security scanning
bandit -r src/

# Configuration validation
python -m src.config.validator --config config/dev.yaml
python -m src.config.validator --config config/prod.yaml

# Plugin dependency validation
python -m src.registry.validator

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/performance/ -m benchmark
```

All checks must pass before code can be merged. The framework includes automatic validation for:

- Plugin dependency resolution
- Configuration schema validation
- Stage assignment verification
- Error handling completeness

## System Initialization for AI Agents

The framework uses a four-phase initialization process:

1. **Phase 1**: Register all plugin classes (order independent)
2. **Phase 2**: Validate dependencies and configuration (fail fast)
3. **Phase 3**: Initialize resources in dependency order
4. **Phase 4**: Instantiate plugins (everything ready)

```python
# Initialize system from YAML
initializer = SystemInitializer.from_yaml("config/prod.yaml")
plugin_registry, resource_registry, tool_registry = await initializer.initialize()

# Execute pipeline
response = await execute_pipeline(user_request)
```

## Error Handling for AI Agents

The framework implements fail-fast error handling:

- **Plugin Failures**: Caught and routed to error stage
- **Tool Failures**: Captured with retry logic
- **System Failures**: Logged with full context
- **User Communication**: Friendly error messages via failure plugins
- **Static Fallback**: Guaranteed response even if error plugins fail

## Multi-Turn and Complex Reasoning

- **Plugin-Level Iteration**: Complex reasoning happens within plugins
- **Single Pipeline Execution**: Each request runs pipeline once
- **Explicit Multi-Turn**: Handle through conversation management
- **Tool Integration**: Tools available throughout all stages
- **State Persistence**: Plugin metadata persists across single execution

## Performance Considerations for AI Agents

- Resources are shared across all plugins for efficiency
- Tools execute immediately when needed (no artificial staging)
- LLM calls are tracked with automatic observability
- Plugin execution order determined by YAML configuration
- Single pipeline execution ensures predictable performance

## Security Guidelines for AI Agents

- Environment variables resolved at system level only
- Plugin context provides controlled access to system resources
- Configuration validation happens before plugin instantiation
- Error information sanitized before user communication
- Plugin dependencies explicitly declared and validated

This framework enables building production-ready AI agents through composable, testable, and observable plugin architectures. All AI agents working with this codebase should follow these patterns and conventions to ensure consistency and reliability.


## Design Principles for AI Agents

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Make simple things simple, complex things possible
2. **15-Minute Rule**: Working agent in 15 minutes or less  
3. **Zero Configuration Default**: Sensible defaults for everything
4. **Async-First**: Consistent async patterns throughout with educational support
5. **Natural Graduation**: Smooth path from simple to sophisticated
6. **Immediate Gratification**: Instant feedback and results
7. **Preserve All Power**: Advanced users lose no capabilities
8. **Community-Friendly**: Easy to contribute and share async plugins
9. **Configuration Over Code**: Behavior defined in YAML, not hardcoded (Layer 2-3)
10. **Plugin Composition**: Multiple plugins work together seamlessly
11. **Resource Agnostic**: Plugins work with/without optional dependencies
12. **Explicit Dependencies**: Missing requirements cause immediate, clear errors
13. **Pipeline Control**: Plugins can short-circuit by setting response or trigger reprocessing
14. **Structured Communication**: Rich context object for plugin collaboration
15. **Fail-Fast Validation**: All plugin dependencies validated statically before instantiation
16. **Observable by Design**: Structured logging, metrics, and tracing built into every plugin
17. **Explicit Stage Assignment**: Plugin stages are always explicitly defined in the plugin class (Layer 2-3; Layer 1 uses smart auto-assignment)
18. **Configuration Flexibility**: Multiple config formats (YAML, JSON, Dict) with secure env interpolation
19. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between config validation and dependency validation
20. **Load-Time Validation**: Validation should be done at load time, reducing runtime errors
21. **Intuitive Mental Models**: Mental models should be intensely easy to understand
22. **Structured LLM Access**: LLM available throughout pipeline with automatic observability
23. **Linear Pipeline Flow**: Simple, predictable execution order with clear stage responsibilities
24. **Immediate Tool Access**: Tools available in any stage with immediate execution and result access
25. **Distributed Tool Execution**: Tools execute when needed with centralized logging for debugging
26. **Plugin-Level Iteration**: Complex reasoning patterns handle iteration internally within plugins
27. **Explicit Multi-Turn Support**: Multi-iteration scenarios handled explicitly through delegation or conversation management
28. **YAML Execution Ordering**: Plugin execution order within stages determined by YAML configuration order (Layer 2-3)
29. **Fail-Fast Error Handling**: Plugin failures are caught early and routed to dedicated error stage
30. **Error Communication**: Technical failures are converted to user-friendly messages
31. **Static Error Fallback**: Reliable fallback responses when error handling itself fails
32. **Standardized Results**: Explicit result keys with no fallback mechanisms
33. **Stage Awareness**: Explicit stage context enables reliable multi-stage plugin behavior
34. **Framework Extension Points**: Base classes enable framework-wide capability additions without plugin changes
35. **Controlled Plugin Access**: Layered context architecture prevents accidental system state corruption
36. **Clear Interface Contracts**: Plugin capabilities explicitly defined through controlled access methods
