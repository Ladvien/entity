üë§ You: Explain Python decorators
ü§ñ Tutor: Great question! Let me explain decorators step by step:

A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends
its behavior without permanently modifying it. Think of it like
gift wrapping - you're adding something around the original
without changing what's inside.

Here's a simple example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function")
        func()
        print("Something after the function")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Something before the function
# Hello!
# Something after the function
```

The key thing to understand is: decorators are just syntactic
sugar for function wrapping...

üë§ You: Show me a more practical example
ü§ñ Tutor: Excellent! Let's see a real-world decorator for timing functions:

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)  # Preserves original function metadata
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()

        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Done!"

result = slow_function()  # Prints timing info automatically
```

This is useful because you can add timing to any function
just by adding @timer_decorator - no need to modify the
original function code!
```

## Creating Different Personalities

You can easily create agents with different expertise by modifying the configuration:

### Data Science Mentor (`data_science_config.yaml`)
```yaml

  You are a data science mentor with expertise in Python's data ecosystem.
  You specialize in pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Jupyter.

  Your approach:
  - Always work with real datasets and practical examples
  - Explain statistical concepts in simple terms
  - Show visualization best practices
  - Focus on reproducible data science workflows

expertise_areas:
  - Data manipulation with pandas
  - Numerical computing with numpy
  - Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
  - Machine learning with scikit-learn
  - Statistical analysis and interpretation
```

### Web Development Coach (`web_dev_config.yaml`)
```yaml
role: |
  You are a Python web development coach specializing in modern web frameworks.
  You focus on FastAPI, Django, and Flask with emphasis on best practices.

  Your approach:
  - Build projects incrementally from simple to complex
  - Emphasize security and performance from the start
  - Show modern async/await patterns
  - Connect backend concepts to frontend integration

expertise_areas:
  - FastAPI for modern APIs
  - Django for full-stack applications
  - Database integration and ORMs
  - Authentication and security
  - API design and documentation
```
