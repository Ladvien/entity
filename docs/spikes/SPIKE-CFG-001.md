# SPIKE-CFG-001: Validation and Hot Reload Overview

## Summary
This document summarizes how the Entity Pipeline handles configuration validation, security, and runtime hot reloading. It draws from the existing architecture guides and troubleshooting notes.

## Validation Strategy
- **Fail-fast validation** ensures initialization stops if any plugin dependencies are missing. Each plugin class implements `validate_config` and `validate_dependencies`, returning `ValidationResult` objects.
- Configuration files can be checked with `python -m src.entity_config.validator --config your.yaml` to see detailed messages before starting the agent.
- Plugins declare required stages and dependencies, and the initializer verifies them up front so execution order is safe.

## Security Considerations
- The review stage performs privacy protection, content filtering, and a final security review to ensure responses meet policy requirements.
- Networking best practices include using VPCs and security groups when deploying on AWS. IAM roles restrict access to databases and S3 buckets.
- Bandit static analysis runs in CI to catch common Python security issues.

## Hot-Reload Options
- The architecture supports **dynamic configuration updates**. Plugins expose a `reconfigure()` method that validates new settings and applies them without restarting the application.
- The CLI provides `reload-config updated.yaml` to load new YAML at runtime, waiting for active pipelines to finish before applying the changes.
