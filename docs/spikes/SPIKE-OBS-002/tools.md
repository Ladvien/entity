# SPIKE-OBS-002: Observability Tools

## Summary
This document surveys visualization and tracing options to help observe and replay the pipeline's behavior. It focuses on Graphviz, Mermaid, and Python tracing utilities.

## Visualization Libraries
### Graphviz
- Mature tool that renders `.dot` files into diagrams.
- Rich layout algorithms for complex graphs.
- Requires installing the Graphviz binaries in the environment.
- Python bindings like `graphviz` or `pygraphviz` can generate diagrams programmatically.
- Best suited when export to static images (SVG, PNG) is needed.

### Mermaid
- Markdown-like syntax for diagrams that integrates well with documentation.
- Can be rendered by many static site generators and GitHub directly.
- No system packages are required; diagrams are drawn in the browser.
- Less precise than Graphviz but easier for quick sketches in docs.

## Execution Tracing
- Python's `trace` module records line execution to a file and can produce coverage-like reports.
- The `sys.settrace` hook allows custom tracing for profiling or recording arguments and return values.
- Thirdâ€‘party packages such as `pytest-replay` and `replay` can capture test runs for deterministic replays.
- For full pipeline replay, storing inputs and intermediate results in a log file enables step-by-step analysis.

## Requirements
1. Choose a graphing tool based on target audience:
   - Use **Graphviz** for precise control and offline rendering.
   - Use **Mermaid** for quick inline documentation diagrams.
2. Ensure the Python environment can install Graphviz binaries if Graphviz is selected.
3. Incorporate tracing hooks that output execution logs suitable for replay scripts.
4. Document how to run the tracing tool and where logs are stored.
