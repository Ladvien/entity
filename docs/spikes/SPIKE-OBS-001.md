# SPIKE-OBS-001: Observability Stack and Monitoring Plan

## Summary
This spike outlines recommended observability tooling for the Entity Pipeline and lists key metrics to monitor.

## Stack Recommendations
- **Prometheus** for time-series metrics collection using exporters for Python and system statistics.
- **Grafana** to visualize metrics and configure alerts.
- **OpenTelemetry** instrumentation within the pipeline to capture traces, metrics, and logs.
- **Loki** as a centralized log store for searchable, aggregated logs.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track pipeline throughput, error counts, and stage latency.
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk I/O on worker nodes.
- Alert on failed pipeline runs, plugin exceptions, and long queue times.
- Visualize user-facing latency and API rate limits from LLM providers.

## Next Steps
- Integrate OpenTelemetry spans in core classes.
- Provide a default Grafana dashboard showing throughput, latency, and failures.
- Document Prometheus scraping and Loki log shipping configuration.
