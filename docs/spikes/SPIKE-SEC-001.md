# SPIKE-SEC-001: Sandboxing and Permission Recommendations

## Summary
This spike outlines strategies for isolating plugins and restricting their permissions. The goal is to prevent a compromised plugin from affecting the host system or accessing data beyond its scope.

## Sandboxing Approaches
- **Process isolation** using containers such as Docker or Podman. Each plugin runs in a minimal image with only the libraries it requires.
- **Seccomp and AppArmor** profiles to limit system calls and filesystem access. Use permissive defaults during development, then tighten them for production.
- **Resource limits** enforced through cgroups to prevent runaway CPU or memory usage.

## Permission Model
- Assign each plugin an identity with the minimum privileges needed. In Kubernetes this maps to a dedicated ServiceAccount with scoped RBAC rules.
- Keep secrets out of images and inject them at runtime through environment variables or a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager.
- Prefer read-only mounts for shared volumes and never mount host devices unless necessary.

## Recommendations
1. Develop plugins so they can run without root privileges.
2. Use a layered defense: containerize plugins, restrict syscalls, and monitor resource usage.
3. Automate policy testing with tools such as `docker scan` or `kube-bench` to validate that containers comply with security guidelines.
