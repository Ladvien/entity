# SPIKE-SEC-002: Security Best Practices and Encryption Options

## Summary
This document outlines recommended practices for securing the Entity Pipeline and reviews available encryption choices. It provides a concise reference for developers when configuring infrastructure or handling sensitive data.

## Security Best Practices
1. **Least Privilege**: Assign minimal IAM permissions to each component. Services and plugins should only access resources they require.
2. **Isolation**: Run agents in isolated environments such as Docker containers or Kubernetes pods. Use dedicated VPCs and security groups when deploying to cloud providers.
3. **Secrets Management**: Store API keys and credentials in a secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) rather than in environment variables or config files.
4. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs. Use the pipeline's built-in validation utilities to reject malformed or dangerous content early in the processing stage.
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable detailed logging for authentication, authorization, and data access events. Forward logs to a secure, centralized location for monitoring.
6. **Dependency Scanning**: Keep dependencies updated and run `bandit` and `pip-audit` in CI to detect vulnerabilities.
7. **Code Reviews**: Require peer reviews for all changes affecting security-related modules or configurations.

## Encryption Options
- **Transport Encryption**: Use TLS for all network traffic between components. Cloud providers often supply managed certificates and automatic rotation.
- **At-Rest Encryption**: Encrypt databases, object storage, and local snapshot files. When possible, use provider-managed keys; otherwise, manage keys using `aws-kms`, `gcloud kms`, or an on-premise solution.
- **Field-Level Encryption**: When storing sensitive fields (e.g., user PII or tokens), encrypt them individually using a library such as `cryptography.fernet`. This protects data even if the overall storage layer is compromised.
- **In-Memory Protection**: Avoid logging secrets and clear sensitive variables when they are no longer needed. Consider using `pynacl` or `libsodium` for secure memory handling if extreme protection is required.

## Recommendations
- Integrate secret management early and avoid passing credentials via CLI arguments or plain-text files.
- Use environment-specific configurations with separate keys to reduce blast radius in case of compromise.
- Review access logs regularly and set up alerts for abnormal patterns, such as repeated login failures or unexpected data exports.

## Next Steps
1. Document the required IAM roles and minimal permissions for each plugin type.
2. Add automated checks to verify that all configuration files reference secrets from the manager instead of plain text.
3. Provide sample Docker Compose files that enable TLS and at-rest encryption out of the box.
