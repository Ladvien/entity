# SPIKE-OBS-002: Visualization Comparisons and Dashboard Options

## Summary
This spike reviews several visualization libraries and dashboard frameworks to determine the best fit for monitoring the Entity Pipeline. The goal is a clear display of pipeline health without excessive overhead.

## Visualization Libraries
### 1. Matplotlib
- Mature and highly configurable.
- Handles static charts well.
- **Pros**: Wide adoption, extensive tutorials.
- **Cons**: Styling can be verbose for simple plots.

### 2. Plotly
- Interactive plots rendered in the browser.
- Supports zooming and tooltips.
- **Pros**: Great for exploratory dashboards.
- **Cons**: Adds JavaScript dependencies and larger bundle size.

### 3. Altair
- Declarative syntax using the Vega-Lite grammar.
- Generates JSON specs consumed by frontâ€‘end libraries.
- **Pros**: Concise, expressive, and integrates with Jupyter easily.
- **Cons**: Limited low-level control compared to Matplotlib.

## Dashboard Frameworks
### 1. Streamlit
- Python-based with minimal boilerplate.
- Live reload during development.
- **Pros**: Quick to build prototypes.
- **Cons**: Less suited for complex layouts.

### 2. Dash
- Built on top of Flask and Plotly.
- Highly customizable callbacks.
- **Pros**: Works well for interactive data apps.
- **Cons**: Slightly heavier setup and more code than Streamlit.

### 3. Grafana
- Focuses on operational metrics and time series.
- Integrates with Prometheus and other data sources.
- **Pros**: Robust alerting and user management.
- **Cons**: Requires external server and configuration.

## Recommendation
Use **Grafana** for monitoring production metrics because it excels at alerting and integrates with existing Prometheus exporters. For ad-hoc analysis and demos, prefer **Streamlit** with **Altair** charts for rapid iteration.

## Risks
- Running Grafana adds another service to maintain.
- Interactive dashboards can bloat dependencies if not scoped carefully.

## Next Steps
1. Document a basic Grafana setup using Docker.
2. Provide Streamlit examples in the `experiments` directory.
