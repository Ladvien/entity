# Fix Resource
Can you please review all of the LLM resources, ensure they use the LLM abstraction.  That is, Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Ollama should all be polymorphic under the LLM resource.  Create tasks needed to fix this.



## Architecture Document Review Request
I'm working on an Python Agent framework design around a plugin system similar to Bevy (Rust).  

Can you take a look at this architecture document and let's discuss the approach.  I'd like you to highlight strength and weaknesses, and give design document a rating between 1-5 (5 = ready for production).

Ok, slight clarification, "production ready" here means we have a design document where we are ready to start building the framework.  That is, it's solid enough to begin coding the framework.

Ok, let's review this architecture document together.  Please be candid, but not cruel.  Highlight recommendations and let's discuss them.  Please address issues one by one, stopping for my feedback after the first issue. Starting with the change most impactful to the overall architecture of the project.

## Update Architecture Document
Can you please update our architecture document with these changes? Please do not lose anything from the original architecture, unless it conflicts with the updates.

## Clean Up
Could you please review this architecture document and clean it up?  Please ensure that the document is well-organized, clear, and concise.  Remove any redundant or unnecessary information, and make sure that the document is easy to read and understand without losing any important information.  It is an architecture document, so even comments can be necessary.  Please summarize each change you would like to make and let's walk through them together.


## Summarize Changes
Can you please summarize the draft changes to our architecture document?

## What Issues?
What issues do you see with these changes?

## What are the tradeoffs?
Or put another way, what are the complications and tradeoffs?

## 
Could you walk me through the updates to the architecture document?  Don't make them yet, just talk me through them.


# Next Steps
Please review the README.md for architectural notes and continue developing this agentic Python framework.  Create tasks in small units that do not overlap for maximum concurrent development without merge conflicts.

# Abstract Resources
Can we review this code.  I'd rather have general resources like "DatabaseResource" that abstract out "PostgresDatabaseResource."  Then, the user only has to worry about learning one interface, but can switch out the backend as much as they'd like.
