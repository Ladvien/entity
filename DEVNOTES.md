## Refactoring 2025-06-22
ğŸ§¯ Tool Usage Limits: Added Then Removed

Originally, a tool usage limit (`max_per_tool`, `max_total`) was implemented to:
- Prevent runaway execution loops
- Cap costs of expensive tools (e.g., API calls)
- Force the agent to reach conclusions with minimal dependencies

However, in practice, this led to frequent premature terminations:
- The agent would hit limits before resolving the task
- Responses like "Agent stopped due to iteration limit" emerged
- Final answers were not produced, degrading UX

ğŸ“Œ Root Cause: Prompt engineering failed to sufficiently incentivize the LLM to reach a conclusion.
Instead of limiting the agent's ability to explore, we needed better instruction in the ReAct prompt.

âœ… Resolution:
Tool usage limits were removed in favor of:
- Improved prompt structure ("you must answer eventually")
- Tool usage feedback (`tool_used` flag) in prompt context
- Agent fallback response if `Final Answer:` is never reached

This shift restored agent reliability while preserving flexibility.
