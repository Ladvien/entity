## ðŸŽ¯ **Epic: Entity Framework Examples & Documentation Overhaul**

### Story 1: Reorganize entity-plugin-examples with Subdirectories
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer learning Entity Framework
**I want** examples organized by category in subdirectories
**So that** I can find relevant patterns quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create subdirectory structure within `entity-plugin-examples/`:
  ```
  core/           # Fundamental concepts
  tools/          # DO stage plugins
  memory/         # Memory patterns
  specialized/    # Domain-specific (code_review, research, etc.)
  patterns/       # Workflows and orchestration
  ```
- [ ] Move existing examples to appropriate subdirectories
- [ ] Update all import paths in example code
- [ ] Ensure tests still pass after reorganization

### Story 2: Create Progressive Core Examples
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 8

**As a** new Entity user
**I want** progressive examples that build on each other
**So that** I understand the architecture step-by-step

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `core/` examples following Layer 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 progression:
  ```
  core/instant_agent/      # Layer 0: Zero config
  core/see_the_pipeline/   # Show 6-stage explicitly
  core/see_the_layers/     # Show 4-layer resources
  core/workflow_templates/ # Named workflows
  core/first_plugin/       # Minimal plugin creation
  ```
- [ ] Each example shows `Agent = Resources + Workflow` equation explicitly
- [ ] Code-first approach: 80% code, 20% explanation
- [ ] Each example builds on previous concepts

---

### Story 3: Refactor Documentation for Conciseness
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer
**I want** concise, code-focused documentation
**So that** I can learn by doing, not reading

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Reduce all README files by 50% word count
- [ ] Replace explanations with executable code examples
- [ ] Use progressive disclosure: start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
- [ ] Remove redundant explanations across documents
- [ ] Keep encouraging tone but be more direct

---

### Story 4: Demonstrate Architecture Patterns
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer building with Entity
**I want** examples of key architectural patterns
**So that** I use the framework correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create examples showing:
  - Constructor injection pattern
  - Dual interface (anthropomorphic vs direct)
  - Multi-stage plugin support
  - Environment variable substitution
- [ ] Each pattern gets minimal example in `patterns/` subdirectory
- [ ] Show pattern, don't explain theory

---

### Story 5: Create Tool Plugin Collection
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer
**I want** reusable tool plugins organized by type
**So that** I can quickly add capabilities to my agent

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Organize tools in `tools/` subdirectory:
  ```
  tools/calculator/
  tools/web_search/
  tools/file_ops/
  tools/data_analysis/
  ```
- [ ] Each tool is independently importable
- [ ] Minimal documentation, maximum code reusability
- [ ] Include tests for each tool category

---

### Story 6: Build Memory Pattern Library
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer
**I want** memory pattern examples
**So that** I can build agents that remember and learn

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `memory/` subdirectory with patterns:
  ```
  memory/conversation_history/
  memory/user_preferences/
  memory/skill_tracking/
  memory/relationship_building/
  ```
- [ ] Each pattern shows practical implementation
- [ ] Focus on code, not memory theory

---

### Story 7: Simplify Getting Started Experience
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 3

**As a** first-time user
**I want** to run my first agent in under 30 seconds
**So that** I see immediate value

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `core/instant_agent/` with 3-line example
- [ ] Show output inline as comments:
  ```python
  agent = Agent()
  await agent.chat("Hello")
  # "Hi! How can I help?" <- This appears immediately
  ```
- [ ] No configuration files required
- [ ] Clear next steps to second example

---

### Story 8: Create Visual Pipeline Demo
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 3

**As a** visual learner
**I want** to see the 6-stage pipeline in action
**So that** I understand message flow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `core/see_the_pipeline/` example
- [ ] Print stage transitions visually:
  ```
  [INPUT] Receiving: "Calculate 2+2"
  [PARSE] Extracting: math expression
  [THINK] Planning: calculation needed
  [DO] Executing: Calculator plugin
  [REVIEW] Validating: result = 4
  [OUTPUT] Formatting: "The answer is 4"
  ```
- [ ] Minimal code, maximum visibility

---

### Story 9: Specialized Plugin Showcases
**Priority**: Low
**Points**: 5

**As a** developer with specific needs
**I want** domain-specific plugin examples
**So that** I can adapt them for my use case

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Organize in `specialized/` subdirectory:
  ```
  specialized/code_reviewer/
  specialized/research_assistant/
  specialized/customer_service/
  ```
- [ ] Each shows complete working system
- [ ] Focus on plugin composition, not individual plugins
- [ ] Include domain-specific test data

---

### Story 10: Update Import Paths and Tests
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 3

**As a** maintainer
**I want** all imports and tests updated
**So that** the reorganization doesn't break existing code

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Update all import statements to match new structure
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with new organization
- [ ] Update CI/CD to test new structure
- [ ] Add migration guide for existing users

---

**Total Points**: 51
**Estimated Timeline**: 2 sprints

These stories focus on making Entity Framework examples the gold standard for progressive, engaging, and concise documentation that teaches through code rather than explanation.
