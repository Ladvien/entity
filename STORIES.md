## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- All plugins must maintain < 100ms overhead
- Support concurrent processing of multiple channels
- Implement caching for repeated reasoning patterns

### Security
- Sandbox all code execution
- Validate all tool inputs/outputs
- Implement rate limiting for expensive operations

### Monitoring
- Structured logging for all plugin operations
- Metrics collection for reasoning levels and tool usage
- Distributed tracing support

### Testing
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Integration tests with actual gpt-oss models
- Load tests for high-concurrency scenarios

## Dependencies

1. **openai-harmony** library for format handling
2. **gpt-oss** Python package for model interaction
3. **Docker** for Python tool containerization
4. **httpx** for browser tool implementation
5. Entity framework core components

## Success Metrics

- **Reasoning Quality**: 30% improvement in complex task completion
- **Performance**: < 2s average response time for medium reasoning
- **Tool Success Rate**: > 95% successful tool executions
- **Safety**: Zero harmful content exposure to end users
- **Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in prompt engineering time
